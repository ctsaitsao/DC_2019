Course-wide project for DSGN 360: Design Competition, Northwestern University, Spring 2019.

## Introduction & Rules
Design Competition (DC) is an annual competition hosted by Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering during spring quarter. It consists of student teams building autonomous or semi-autonomous robots that complete a task. The official rules for the 2019 competition were:

*"The arena is divided into two 6' x 6' squares, with a barrier between them to block the view of the driver. Teams place their robot in the opposing square, and their four tokens in their own square.*

*The team that first removes all of their opponents tokens wins. If after 3 minutes neither team has removed all of the tokens, points are awarded for the tokens that have been removed: 4 points for the smallest down to 1 for the largest. The team with the most points wins. In the event of a tie, the round is run again. In the event of three ties, the winner is decided by coin toss.*

*A removed token has been pushed off or ejected from the 6' square.*

*Your robot must fit in a 10" cube at the beginning of the round. The robot may be remote controlled by a driver using Bluetooth-classic and a computer program. Data may be streamed in either direction. The robot can be fully autonomous, semi autonomous, or fully remote controlled."*
